#Script to start experiments easily and generate results.
#The script holds the terminal busy until the results are processed. So you might want
#to multiplex it with tmux/screen. Also, you can't submit jobs while these are going on.

#args: $1: Name of the code executing. $2 Name of the experiment, $3 Size of the matrix to be passed on to the Python script.
